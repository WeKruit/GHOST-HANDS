    "whyThisCompany": "I'm excited about [COMPANY] because of its mission to [MISSION]. My experience building scalable systems at Stripe and Lyft aligns perfectly with the technical challenges you're solving. I'm particularly interested in [SPECIFIC_PROJECT/TEAM].",
    "whyThisRole": "This role combines my passion for backend systems and my experience with real-time data processing. At Stripe, I built fraud detection pipelines handling millions of transactions, which directly translates to the scale challenges mentioned in the job description.",
    "greatestStrength": "My greatest strength is translating complex technical problems into elegant, scalable solutions. At Stripe, I reduced fraudulent transactions by 34% through a Kafka-Flink pipeline, saving $4.2M annually.",
    "greatestWeakness": "I sometimes dive too deep into technical details when a simpler solution exists. I've learned to step back, validate assumptions with stakeholders, and prioritize pragmatic solutions over perfect ones.",
    "conflictResolution": "At Lyft, I disagreed with a senior engineer about our matching algorithm approach. I ran A/B tests comparing both methods, shared data-driven results, and we collaborated on a hybrid solution that improved metrics by 22%.",
    "careerGoals": "In 5 years, I see myself as a tech lead or engineering manager, leading a team solving high-impact distributed systems problems. I want to mentor engineers while staying close to the technical work.",
    "whyLeaving": "I'm looking for a role with deeper technical challenges in [DOMAIN] and opportunities to work on systems at even greater scale. Stripe gave me incredible growth, and I'm ready for the next challenge.",
    "expectedSalary": "Based on my experience and market research, I'm targeting $180,000-$220,000 base salary, plus equity. I'm flexible and open to discussing total compensation.",
    "availableStartDate": "I can start with 2 weeks' notice from the offer acceptance date.",
    "diversityStatement": "As a woman in tech, I'm passionate about building inclusive engineering cultures. At Lyft, I co-founded a women in engineering group that grew to 50+ members and ran monthly mentorship sessions."
